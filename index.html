                            <p>To me, this is UNACCEPTABLE.</p>
                            <p>According to the National Fire Protection Association.</p>
                            <p>More than one-quarter <span class="psebo">(27%)</span> of reported fires occurred in homes. Even worse, four of every five<span class="psebo"> (79%)</span> fire deaths and three-quarters <span class="psebo">(73%) </span>of all reported injuries were caused by home fires
</p>
                            <p class="pp">Why?
</p>
                            <p class="pp">Because of the inability to safely contain a smaller fire.

                            <p>I had to deal with these problems and the consequences of letting them get out of hand.</p>
                            <p><span class="psebo">During my 10 years as a fire fighter, I’ve dealt with countless fire and listened to the tragic tales of how they happened.</span></p>
                            <p>I’ve dealt with fires that started out small, but inexperience and improper methods quickly led to an out of control blaze.</p>
                            
                        
                            <p>Oil fires that people tried to put out using water made the fire spread even quicker...</p>
                            <p>Smoke inhalation because of inefficient fire prevention...</p>
                           <!-- <p><span class="psebo">NONE OF IT SEEMED TO WORK.</span></p> -->
                            <p>Lives lost because all ways of escape were blocked off by fire.</p>
                                <p>If it wasn’t lives lost, it was homes and precious belongings all gone due to a lack of proper protection.   </p>
                            <p>THEN, I realized that fire experts had already implemented a solution.</p>
                            <p>For decades, they’ve researched and refined a quick way to put out small fires before they could grow.</p>
                            <p><span class="psebo">Big companies have invested so that fire fighters can save lives in seconds.</span></p>
                            <p> Using the same principles that are used to fight fires, you too can keep you, your home, and your family safe!</p>
